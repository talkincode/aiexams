    "question": "Read the following passage and answer the questions based on the content:\n\nWhen Airman was 4 years old, Airman fell off a train and his eyes were badly hurt. Since then, he couldn't see anything. In fact, although Airman became blind, he learnt to love his life more. But he had a hard time before he was successful. The hardest lesson was to believe in himself and it had to start with the simplest things. One day a girl gave Airman a baseball. He thought she was laughing at him and he was sad. “I can't use this,” he said. “Take it with you and roll it around,” the girl smiled and said. Her words got into his head. “Roll it around!” By rolling the ball Airman could hear where it went. This gave him an idea to do something he never thought of: playing baseball. Years after that, he invented a successful game of baseball for the blind. They called it ground ball. From then on, Airman began to smile at life and achieved more dreams. It would be hard for Airman to be blind in his life, but bad luck may not be always bad.\n\n56. How old was Airman when he fell off a train?\n57. What was the hardest lesson for him?\n58.
